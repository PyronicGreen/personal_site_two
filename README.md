# personal_site_two

4/12/21 - This is the main personal site I'm using as the foundation.
Currently, there are issues with the Projects page overlapping the contact.
I also want smooth scroll and an animated star background on the home page.
I also need to link to my resume, update my bio and format my bio picture.
Lots to do!
